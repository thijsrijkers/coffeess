<p> CoffeeSS (called coffees) is a small library that translate a custom CSS syntax that can be used inside a .COSS file. You can use it by simply installing it with the NPM CLI:</p>

```shell
npm i coffeess
```

CoffeeSS has a simple syntax thats easy to understand. The idea of this syntax is to create a smoothed out version of the css syntax. With this syntax the developer doenst have to use brackets, semicolons and standard class/id tags. A example of this syntax is as followed:

```shell
id test 
  font-family: verdana
  font-size: 20px

class test 
  font-family: verdana
  font-size: 20px
```
